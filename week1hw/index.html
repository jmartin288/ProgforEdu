         <h2 style="color: pink; font-family: cursive; background-color: moccasin;">About Me</h2>
       <p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-color: moccasin;">Graduate from Bellarmine University Masters in Education and ASU Masters in TESOL. I have used many technology programs to teach language, both English and Spanish. 
        While these programs have been a major advancement to language learning, I feel there is always a 
        need for improvement. As an educator, I would like to change the way people learn languages. Through technology I hope to reach students around the world who may not have access to education. Without education, many cannot break out of the cycle of poverty. I have taught Spanish for six years in Louisville, Ky. I moved to Costa Rica to teach in international schools and work with impoverished children for four years. Now, I am an ESOL teacher in Bradenton, Fl. Everyday I hope to improve the lives' of my students through education and language acquistion. I do not have much experience with designing technology, but if my students can learn a new language, I can learn the language of technology</p>
